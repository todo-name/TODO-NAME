# TODO-NAME

## Mission Statement
To help the individual get through a difficult day.

## Problem Statement
The challenge of making it through a difficult day is one that every person will face, often on a daily basis. When facing a difficult day, often all that's needed is a single burst of happiness to give someone the confidence they need. However, a single burst of happiness is not always able to be delivered; people can struggle through the day and end up even unhappier as a result.
