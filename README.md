# TODO-NAME

## Mission Statement
To help the individual get through a difficult day.

## Problem Statement
The challenge of making it through a difficult day is one that every person will face, often on a daily basis. When facing a difficult day, often all that's needed is a single burst of happiness to give someone the confidence they need. However, a single burst of happiness is not always able to be delivered; people can struggle through the day and end up even unhappier as a result.

In order to better one's mood and increase motivation, people often go on the dogfinding Facebook page. The problem with this is that
Facebook can add extra distractions and people end up looking at more things than just dogs. In addition, not all pictures can be filtered for breed of dog or location as the metadata for this search does not exist.
