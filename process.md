## Process Specification

* How will you communicate with teammates you depend on? Describe specific tools or contexts.  

	**Facebook Messenger**
	- Use for questions and clarifications.
	- Use for small updates and notification.  

	**Github**
	- Use for storing code files and project related files.

	**Google Docs**
	- Use for group assignments.

	**Google Drive**
	- Use to keep track of all homework files.

* What coordination and planning practices will you follow?
> Identify daily scrums, sprint planning meetings, ad hoc meetings, or other ways of coordinating work.   
We will meet twice in class weekly, discussing issues in class and then work on these issues outside of class. Meetings outside of class will be done by appointment if necessary. We will update progress on a progress tracker via Google Docs.

* Who will own each of the components in your architecture? Owning them means being responsible for writing them and making sure they are functional and correct.
> - Stanley will be responsible for making the front-end for the search box, login, and sign up functionalities.
> - Austin will be responsible for the upload and post grid functionalities.
> - Min will own the navigation bar, and the popup enabling copying a post URL and reporting a post.
> - Luke will own the database, and the API that controls content management.

* By what date will you have a release candidate?
> We should have a release candidate by Friday the 7th so we have a buffer time before the final due date to check for minor errors and other functionality.

* What practices will you use to know if you're making progress toward that release candidate?
> We will list out tasks that each team member needs to get done on an excel sheet. Each team member will update the status of each task so that everyone knows what point people are on and to check progress. There will be due dates on the tasks and when a task is finished, we will label the task with “done”, our initials, and date. We will also add extra notes about dependencies or possible changes in design by tasks for further communication with teammates.

* What practices will you follow to improve your process if it's not working?
> Based on our task document/spreadsheet, we can determine when work was started on what component. If our process isn’t working, we will analyze this document and determine what step we went wrong at. Additionally, if team members are struggling with individual assignments, we will communicate with each other during our meetings to ensure that all the work gets done.
